A To-Do List app developed using Android Kotlin is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users manage their tasks effectively. Here's a brief description of the app:

1. **Purpose**: The app is designed to keep track of tasks that users want to complete in the future. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

2. **User Interface**: The app's user interface includes a floating '+' button at the right bottom corner of the home screen. When clicked, a new activity appears with a text field where users can add the task name.

3. **Functionality**: The 'Save' button saves the newly entered task details onto the ROOM database and displays it on the home screen. Tasks can be marked as complete using a checkbox.

4. **Development**: The app is developed using Android Studio and the programming language Kotlin. It also uses XML for developing the applicationâ€™s user interface. The ROOM DAOs are used for database management.
